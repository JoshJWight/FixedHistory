# Level Design Knowledge

## Interactive Objects in Levels

The introduction of Door objects into levels marks a significant evolution in the game's design:

- Doors add a new layer of interactivity and complexity to levels
- They create opportunities for more intricate puzzles and navigation challenges
- Doors work in conjunction with Switches, creating cause-and-effect relationships in the game world
- The placement of doors can significantly affect the flow and difficulty of a level

Key considerations when placing doors in levels:
- Think about how doors will affect player movement and progression through the level
- Consider the relationship between doors and switches, and how this creates puzzles
- Be mindful of how doors interact with the game's time manipulation mechanics
- Use doors to create interesting choices for the player, rather than just as obstacles

Remember that the introduction of doors changes the fundamental nature of level design in the game. Each door placement should be purposeful and contribute to the overall game experience.
